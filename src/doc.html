<h1 align="center">Frontend-Bet_Manager</h1>

<p>A nOS distributed application to store and manage bets in a group of people ensuring that winners will always be payed</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>This dApp uses nOs to connect to the Blockchain-powered Smart Economy.</p>

<p>First thing it is necessary to install and start <a href="https://github.com/nos/client">nOs client</a>:</p>

<p><strong>nOs client setup</strong></p>

<pre><code>// Cloning from Github
git clone https://github.com/nos/client.git

// Install dependencies and launch the nOS client
// This is used to start developing on the nOS client
yarn install &amp;&amp; yarn start
</code></pre>

<p>Second thing it is necessary to install and start this repository:</p>

<p><strong>bet_manager setup</strong></p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">git clone https://github.com/MarcoBz/Frontend-Bet_Manager.git
cd Frontend-Bet_Manager
yarn install
yarn start
</code></pre>

<p>Third thing you need to build and import the bet_manager <a href="https://github.com/MarcoBz/smartcontract-bet_manager">smartcontract</a> into your privatenet and change the <em>const scriptHash</em> in <em>index.js</em> file</p>

<h2 id="howitworks">How it works</h2>

<p>A Group with all possible participants at future bets needs to be created in the dApp inserting the name of the group and the NEO address of all of them.</p>

<p>When a bet is proposed, it has to be created in the dApp inserting its text, at least two possible results, the amount of tokens that has to be bet, the blocks length of all the periods in the bet's lifetime (they are described later) and it has to be checked or not if a player can add a new result.</p>

<p>Each person in the group can participate to the bet choosing one of the possible results and sending to the smartcontract the previously amount of tokens.</p>

<p>When the bet event ends, the result can be validated by all the participants in the group and if one result reaches 50 % + 1 of group participants, it is the winning result and winners can withdraw all the amount previously bet.</p>

<h2 id="betlifetime">Bet Lifetime</h2>

<p>The lifetime of a bet consists in 4 steps:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/bet_lifetime.PNG" width="80px" />
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: Period of time (calculated in block)  during  which everybody in the group can participate choosing one result and once the player has chosen it and the transaction is confirmed, he cannot change it. If the bet allows it, one player can also propose a new result inserting it in the proper field and choosing it. Choosing one result /////</li>

<li><strong>Close</strong>:  Period of time (calculated in block)  during  which the bet event takes place, no actions can be done.</li>

<li><strong>OnValidation</strong>:  Period of time (calculated in block)  during  which  everybody in the group can validate one result of the bet choosing it, until this period ends one player can change its validation. </li>

<li><strong>Validated</strong>: Final step in bet life. If one result has been validated by at least 50 % + 1 of group participants, it is the winning result and winner players can withdraw all the amount previously bet. If there isn't any result validated by at least 50 % + 1 of group participants or nobody has chosen the winning one, every player can withdraw its own amount of tokens (refund).</li>

<h2 id="finalconsiderations">Final Considerations</h2>

<ul>
<li>The dApp is coded in Vanilla javascript and Jquery, I'm learning Vue.js in order to rewrite the code in a second moment</li>

<li>Since this is just a PoC to see how the dApp works and I'm still learning how to manage verification scripts, send tokens and withdraw tokens, for this moment the smartcontract uses the storage as a database of all fictional transactions in order to have a total balance for each player. In future I'm going to implement real transactions of tokens to and from the smartcontract.</li>

<li>I'm thinking to store all data using IPFS in order to have only to save the hashes into the storage</li>

<ul>
<li>neo-python == 0.6.9</li>

<li>neo-boa == 0.4.2</li>
